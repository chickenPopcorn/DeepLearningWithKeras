# PyDataAmsterdam2018
Contents of the workshop ["Hands-on introduction to Deep Learning with Keras and Tensorflow"](https://pydata.org/amsterdam2018/schedule/) I gave at PyData Amsterdam 2018.

#### Create the conda environment
```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```
#### Launch jupyter notebooks from repo root folder
```
jupyter notebook
```

**Audience level**: Novice

## Description
Deep Learning has already conquered areas such as image recognition, NLP, voice recognition, and is a must-know tool for every Data Practitioner. This tutorial for aspiring Deep Learners will consist of a quick blunt Deep Learning overview followed by a hands-on tutorial that will teach you how to get started using Keras and Tesorflow.

## Abstract
Deep Learning has already conquered areas such as image recognition, NLP, voice recognition, and is a must-know tool for every Data Practitioner. This tutorial for aspiring Deep Learners will consist of a quick blunt Deep Learning overview followed by a hands-on tutorial that will teach you how to get started using Keras and Tesorflow.
